### ANTLR Setup
This directory contains work necessary to get the open source code parsing sytem ANTLR to work for our project.

Each subdirectory contains the ANTLR parser and lexer files needed for C/C++ parsing.  The \_preprocessing subdirectory ignores whitespaces and comments while the other two directoriy names specify if they ignore only whitespaces or only comments.  The test_cpp.c file is just a sample file to verify that the parsing is behaving as intended.
