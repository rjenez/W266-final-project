Similarity within 1st 512
In some cases seems to ignore comments

False negative
MOSS 99 similar 136 lines - A2016/Z1/Z1/student5512 studen4852 - 136 lines - different variable names - uppercase vs mixed case file long so commonality missed. Size is 3K
MOSS 99 similar 32 lines A2016/Z1/Z4/student6054 7341 - different variable names  - length 436
MOSS 98 similar 119 lines  A2016/Z4/Z2/student5939 student5581 similar - more comments. File size 1595 characters. - comment pushes out similarity.
——
Variable names different
Large file so similarity may not be seen in 512
Comments push out the ability to see similarity in code



False positive:
Moss 2: differences of include files student2676 student3376 : ignores include files, different program names, different … differences mainly after 512 characters.

Moss: 2 file size significant different. Beginning of files not exactly similar. Comments seem ignored. Variable names different. Seems quite different but false positive. Some keyword?

MOSS: 3: lines 4 files size different 3 lines similar student7392 student9823,  comments, move things around? Same variable names. Files sizes very different. More differences after 512? File sizes 3978
Differences at the end.

Moss score: 3: A2016/G5/Z2/student 7392 6723: only similar in the beginning. Not a lot of similarity. Comparison too short?
————
Similarity in first 512 - files longer up to 4K
Seems to ignore dissimilar comments
Model may have learned something about specific file


True negative:
MOSS score: 99 lines 34: student z1/z4/student6547 student8317 .exactly the same 
MOSS score 99: z4/z3/student3900 student7802 — exactly the same
MOSS score 98 37 similar: z2/z3/student7249 student9451: variable names different but still managed to match. No comments.
Moss score 98 Z2/Z3/student9451 2340 - long comments wich probably does not all code to be seen. Different variable names.
MOSS score 99: Exactly the same student/z1/z2/student9524 student2406 - may be new line tabs. - only difference is one variable name - number of lines 37

MOSS score 97 - 110 lines z4/z4/student8631 student8753 files very different MOSS clearly off.

MOSS score 97 15 lines A2016/z1/z2/student8430 student6634 - one different variable name.
MOSS score 97 172 lines A2016/Z1/Z1/student4860 student9923 different variable names big file everything else similar.
MOSS score 2 11 lines A2016/Z5/Z2/student6369 student3841completely different.

Summary:
——————
0. Case sensitivity
1. Dealing with comments
2. Dissimilarity with variable names
3. File differences or similarity measure beyond 512 tokens - need to handle larger files
4. Not enough samples so model may be learning more about specific file
5. Need more samples?
